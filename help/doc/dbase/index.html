A database organizes data into a data hierarchy.
A field is the smallest component that conveys a specific meaning or purpose.
A record is a set of one or more fields concerning one individual or case.
A file is a set of one or more related records, grouped together by purpose.
A database is a set of related files.
For example, the employee database for a company may consist of two files,
one for payroll and another for job classification.
The two files probably share no common fields other than an employee identification
number or a job title. In the payroll file, there will be one record for each employee.
Each record will consist of a number of fields and will probably include the employee
identification number, the employee name, the job title, the employee's social security
number, and a weekly salary.
<p>
In designing a database, you must know:
<p>
    <ul>
    	<li>what questions are to be answered?</li>
    	<li>what data are required?</li>
    	<li>what database model is best for the application?</li>
    </ul>
<p>
Decide first on the number and purpose of the files in the database.
Many simple databases have only one file.
Next, select the fields in the database(s).
Can you answer all the required questions with the fields you have selected?
When laying out your database, sketch the database structure.
Always put the fields to be used most frequently at the beginning of the record.
This order will allow you to see the most important data on the screen without scrolling.
